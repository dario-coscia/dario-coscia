### Hi there, I'm Dario ðŸ‘‹

I'm doing a MSc in Foundations of AI and ML at the University of Trieste.  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m doing **research** at [*mathLab*](https://mathlab.sissa.it/) @ SISSA
  - Generative Adversarial Learning
  - Convolutional Neural Network in unstructured domains
  - Constructing deep learning arichitectures for numerical analysis modelling 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently interested in 
  - Deep Learning applications for numerical analysis
  - Physics Informed Neural Networks
  - Neural Network Optimization 
  
- ðŸ‘€ Have a look at my [**website**](https://dariocoscia.wixsite.com/datascience)
- ðŸ“š Here my last [**pubblication**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13416) on convolutional trainable filters for unstructured data
